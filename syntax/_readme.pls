# This is a scratchpad to show my ideas for syntax
# This is not an example of implemented features, this is only a soft guideline
# for where I want to take this project.
# PS: This is the syntax for comments.  There are no multiline comments

# You'll notice a lot of parallels to Ruby.  That's intentional, as I'm taking
# design cues from Katz and friends
