# Polite Programming Language

(Name TBD)

## What is this?

I want to stumble through creating a simple language.  This language will not fulfil any special niches, but instead be just for fun.

The syntax will be overly polite and as simple as possible.

## Who's this for?

Me

## Goals?

None so far, just get the language running.  This repo will serve as a scratchpad and will not have any real direction.

Probably not OOP?  We shall see.

## Anything else?

While this will *probably* be compiled, that's up for debate when I get there.

If it will be compiled/transpiled, I was thinking of writing the compiler in C++, Go, or Rust.  
But for this initial prototype it'll be in Ruby, as that will allow me to strike a balance between iteration speed and preservation of sanity.  
Once I know what direction I want to head, I'll be re-writing the it in one of the aforementioned languages (probably C++ or Go)
